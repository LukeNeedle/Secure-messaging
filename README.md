# Secure messaging
 My A-Level Computer Science NEA

My project is a secure messaging system that schools could use to communicate with staff members.

### Features I would like to include are:
- Staff-to-staff messaging – Private messaging between staff and file exchanging

- Staff-to-group messaging – Staff can send notices to groups of people.

- Alert – Staff can send a notification to all staff who should receive the alert. This message should appear on the home page for each of the notified staff members so that it is easy to see.

- Secure reporting – Staff can securely record conversations, concerns, and information about students. These records can only be seen by members of SENCo and safeguarding.

- Student notify – Sending a message to all appropriate people for a student (Head of year, tutor, teachers for the day, etc.).

- Multi-factor authentication

- Full system control for admin accounts – The ability to track logins, enable/disable features, force multi-factor sign-on, etc.

- Student reports – Staff can draft, finalise, and send off for review reports for their students.

The system should be run locally with ideally no access to the internet so that it is more secure. Although this means that staff cannot use the system from home, it also stops hackers from attacking it.

## Objectives

1.	Encryption of student reports (Secure reporting)
2.	Account system
3.	Sending messages
4.	Uploading attachments
5.	Admin page
6.	Linking teachers to students (for Student notify)
